# Aerofit Treadmill Customer Analysis


Problem Statement:

Aerofit, a treadmill manufacturer, has collected customer data, including demographic and usage metrics: Gender, Age, Income, Weekly Usage, Fitness, Marital Status, and Miles run on the treadmill. The goal is to analyze this data to understand the factors that influence a customer's decision to purchase one of three treadmill models: KP281, KP481, and KP781. These models increase in price, with KP781 being the most expensive. By examining the characteristics of customers who purchased each model, we aim to identify trends and patterns that can be used to predict future purchases. Additionally, based on customer profiles, we will recommend which treadmill would be the best fit for future customers

Furthermore, the analysis will:

Highlight specific demographic groups more likely to purchase high-end models, such as KP781, compared to budget models like KP281.

Investigate whether income and fitness level play a larger role in treadmill selection than other factors, like age or marital status.

Provide Aerofit with targeted marketing strategies to attract potential customers based on the identified trends, helping them allocate resources more effectively.

Develop a predictive model that can suggest the optimal treadmill for a customer based on their profile, enhancing customer satisfaction and sales efficiency.
